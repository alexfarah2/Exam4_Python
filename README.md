# Exam4_Python

This project shows a few functions that will complete a goal of analyzing a kmer sequence. It will be able to be typed in to the command line and completed from the command line. The goal of this project was to: 
(1) Define a function that identifies all substrings of size (k), and all unique possible subsequent substrings of each dubstring.
(2) Define a function that uses the first function to identify all possible substrings and subsequent substrings for all sequences read from a file.
(3) Define a function that identifies the smallest k value using the previous functions.

##Installation
To do this project you will need to:
Clone the repository
Install python3 (or have python3 already)
Have a terminal to run the application on the command line.

##How to Use
The following commands are provided. 
To only do the first function (goal 1) type into the command line
python3 exam4_q1.py 'a value for K ex:2'

To do the second function (goal 2) type into the command line
python3 exam4_q2.py 'a value for K ex:3' 'path to file'

To do the third function (goal 3) type into the command line
python3 exam4_q3.py ' a vaule for K ex:3' 'path to file'

To test the functions, type into the command line: 
pytest 

I provided the sample.txt that I used to test the functions when I was making them. 
I also wrote the answer to question 7 at the end of the q3 code. 

##Thanks for a great semester!
